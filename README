This package contains utilities for manipulating OMFS filesystems, 
and a small test suite.

omfsck 
~~~~~~
Omfsck is the filesystem consistency checker.

Running omfsck will check the disk for errors, and prompt before 
correcting them.

Usage:
 $ omfsck /path/to/device

omfsdump
~~~~~~~~
Omfsdump displays the contents of an OMFS filesystem along with various
information.

Usage:
 $ omfsdump /path/to/device

mkomfs
~~~~~~
Mkomfs makes a simple root directory filesystem on a device or disk image.

Usage:
  $ mkomfs [options] /path/to/device

Where options is zero or more of:

 -b	set FS block size (defaults to 8192).  No size smaller than 2048
        should be used.
 -c 	set cluster size in blocks (defaults to 8).  This is the normal
	allocation size for a file.
 -x	clear the device when initializing (defaults to off).
