README for omfsprogs 
Bob Copeland <me@bobcopeland.com>

This package contains utilities for manipulating OMFS filesystems.
These programs are very beta.  Watch out.

omfsck: Consistency checker for the filesystem.  Only a few errors may be 
fixed at this time, and then only by deleting them wholesale.

mkomfs: Makes a simple root directory filesystem on a device or disk image.
